# visual-argument

My project intends to depict a serious issue for social media. The issue I'm focusing on is how echo chambers can really skew a person's point of view, while they think that they are right at the same time. This can lead to having people believe in false information but also providing evidence for the false information to make them feel more justified. When it comes to the internet, it is important that everyone is critically thinking and making sure that they are looking at all angles of an issue or topic.
